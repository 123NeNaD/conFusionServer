//One of the options that "multer" takes is for the storage. So, "multer" provides this "disk.Storage()" function which 
//enables us to define the storage engine and in here we can configure a few things. The options that we are going to 
//define are "destination" and "filename". "destination" allows us to configure the destination and it is a function that
//takes "req" (request), object called "file" which contains information about the file that has been processed by "multer", and
//a "callback" function. Through the callback function, we will pass information back to "multer" configuration. "callback" function
//takes two parameters, first is "error" and a second is a destination folder where the files will be stored and it can be expresses
//as a string. Posto cemo mi u ovoj vezbi da implementiramo "image uploads", "destination folder" cemo da stavimo da nam bude 
//"public/images", i sve slike koje "upload"-ujemo ce biti smestene u "public/images" folder. "filename" funkcionise na 
//slican nacin. Isto je funkcija koja prima tri parametra, "red", "file" i "callback" funkciju. Through the callback function, 
//we will pass information back to "multer" configuration."callback" function takes two parameters, first is "error" and a second
//is file name that is going to be used for the specific file when that file is stored. "file" object suports several properties
//on it, and one of the properties is called "originalname". The "originalname" gives us the original name of the file from the
//client side that has been uploaded. Now, we insist that, when the file is saved on the server side, the file will be given exactly
//the same name as the original name of the file that has been uploaded. Now, if you don't configure this, then "multer" by default
//will give some random string as the name of the file with no extensions. That may not be something that we would be happy about 
//using in this particular exercise. So, that's why we are explicitly configuring saying that, the file should be stored with the 
//original name of the file that has been uploaded.

//We can also specify a file filter for the "multer" configuration. The file filter will enable us to specify which kind of files
//we are willing to accept for uploading. Definisemo funckiju "imageFileFilter" koja prima tri parametra, kao i funkcije "destination"
//i "filename". Parametri su "req", "file" i "callback" funkcija. Through the callback function, we will pass information back to "multer"
//configuration. Posto je "file.originalname" string, proveravamo da li se ime fajla zavrsava sa nekom od ekstenzija koje navodimo u
//regularnom izrazu. Ako se zavrsava sa nekom od ekstenzija koju smo naveli, onda cemo omoguciti "upload"-ovanje fajla. Ako se ne zavrsava
//sa nekom od ekstenzija koju smo naveli, necemo dati korisniku da "upload"-uje fajl. "callback" funkcija prima dva parametra, prvi je 
//error, a drugi je true/false sto znaci da dopustamo ili ne dopustamo "upload"-ovanje fajla.
