//Now, why do we use this "port+443"? In a standard server, if your server is acting as a web server, your HTTP protocol 
//will be running at port number 80 on your server. And the HTTPS will run on port number 443.
//Now, you would normally not want to use those reserved ports in a development application that we are doing in this course.
//Instead, as you saw earlier, we had configured our port number to 3000 where our HTTP server is running. 
//So we are going to be running the HTTPS server at port number 3443. So 3000 plus 443. So that's the reason 
//why we are declaring this "secPort" (secure port) as "port+443". We will still be running the HTTP server at port 3000.
//Now, the reason why we are going to still run the HTTP server is that, if we get a request on the HTTP server's port, 
//then that request will be redirected to the HTTPS server. So our server will only service requests coming in on the 
//HTTPS port. But if by chance anybody accesses the server at the HTTP port, I will redirect that request to the HTTPS port.
